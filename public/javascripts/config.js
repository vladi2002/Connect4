/* Code shared between client and server: game setup.
 *
 * The different properties (MIN_WORD_LENGTH and so on) are game properties that
 * need to be shared between client and server (both the client and server need to
 * be in agreement of the game properties of course).
 *
 * We can of course maintain two separate files (one for the Node.js env and one for the browser)
 * but it is less work and less error-prone to simply havea  single *.js file that contains the
 * properties both the client and server can use.
 *
 * We can achieve this with the code snippet below: if the 'exports' is undefined, we are in the web
 * browser environment and need to create a property ('Setup') for the 'this' object.
 * If 'exports' is defined, we are on the server and can simply return the exports object.
 *
 * This is a common JavaScript construct to share code between the Node.js and web browser environments.
